# GTEventGenerator
Gran Turismo 5 &amp; 6 Tool to create custom events and categories. **This tool is mainly targetted for GT6, but should work for GT5.**

This is a near full rewrite in WPF of the original tool made by TheAdmiester that allowed basic event creation. This one aims to be a lot more complete by having all features present for an event.
It is not yet finished.
